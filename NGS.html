		<h4>Introduction</h4>
		<p>Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is a term used to describe an array of gene sequencing. NGS followed after First Generation Sequencing and may be followed by Third Generation Sequencing below details more. </p>

	<section class="Section1">
		<h4> First Generation Sequencing </h4>
		<p>First generation sequencing methods emerged during the 1970s the most prominnent being Sanger Sequencing.</p>
		<p> In Sanger Sequencing DNA synthesis is initated on a template strand and randomly terminates when a termination nucleotide is randomly incorporated. The DNA fragments that have been produced are denatured into single stranded DNA, seperated by size using gel electrophoresis and the sequence is deduced based on the results of the gel electrophoresis.

		<h4>Next Generation Sequencing </h4>
		<p> Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is a term used to describe an array of gene sequencing methods that sequence DNA by 1) generating DNA libraries 2) sequencing the DNA by the addition of nucleotides to the complementary strand 3) The simultaneous sequencing of DNA templates generated in the first two steps. </p>
		<p>One common method of NGS is illumnia sequencing.</p>

	<section class="Section3">
		<h4> Third Generation Sequencing? </h4>
		<p> Third-generation sequencing (TGS) (also known as long-read sequencing) is a class of DNA sequencing methods currently under active development. TGS technologies have the capability to produce substantially longer reads than NGS. However, TGS data have much higher error rates than previous technologies.</p> <p> An example of TGS is Oxford Nanopore wherby electrical signals are used to determine the sequence of DNA. </p>
