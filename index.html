		<h4> <a href="NGS.html"> What is Next Generation Sequencing?</a> </h4>
		<p>Next Generation Sequencing is the process where genomes or transcriptomes are fragmented into millions of short oligonucleotides, that are read at single base level and the information computationally assembled to provide long reads.</p>

		<h4> <a href="PM.html">What is Personalised Medicine?</a> </h4>
		<p> Personalised medicine is a term used to describe the concept of tailoring medical treatments to the specific characteristics of each patient. </p>

		<h4> <a href="CRC.html">Colorectal Cancer</a> </h4>
		<p> Colorectal cancer (CRC) is cancer of the colon or rectum. The colon is the large intestine and the rectum is a passageway that connects the colon/large intestine to the anus. </p>
	</section>

	<section class="section4">
		<h4> <a href="NGS_CRC.html">Next Generation Sequenceing in Colorectal Cancer</a></h4>
		 <p> With Next Generation Sequencing, the ability to generate a genomic profile of a tumour has led to the potential for personalised treatments that seek to tailor the therapy for subpopulations that display certain characteristics. </p>
