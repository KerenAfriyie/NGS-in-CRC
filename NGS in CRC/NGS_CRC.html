	<section class="section1"> <h4> Introduction </h4>
		<p> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11252">The Cancer Genome Atlas</a> is a project which utilised next generation sequencing (NGS) to profile genomic changes in 20 different cancers including Colorectal Cancer (CRC). Exome sequence analysis revealed mutations associated with CRC. </p>
		<p>With NGS, the ability to generate a genomic profile of a CRC tumour has led to the potential for personalised treatments that seek to tailor the therapy for subpopulations that display certain characteristics. Below I will discuss some examples of these therapies based on genes that are mutated in CRC.</p>

	 <h4> APC </h4>
		<p> Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is a tumour suppressor gene for CRC. It can be mutated at both the germline and somatic level. Germline mutations of APC result in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and somatic mutations are seen in an overwhelming majority of sporadic CRC cases. The association between APC loss of function and CRC is mainly caused by APC’s role in down regulating the oncogenic signalling pathways involved in the Wnt signalling pathway. Without APC function the suppressive action is lost. </p>

		<p>‘Enhancer translation read through is where ribosomes ignore premature stop codons to generate full-length proteins’. A study conducted by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.32557"> Karviv et al., 2020 </a> on ten patients with FAP nonsense mutations of APC were treated for four months with erythromycin to cause read-through of the APC gene. Analysis of the cohort showed a decerease in poulposis burden. </p> 

		<p>Current treatment for FAP involves prophylactic surgery to remove the colon and potentially the rectum. The results of this study shows that read-through therapy could potentially provide a way to delay or even rule out this prophylactic surgery in young patients with attenuated FAP (possessing nonsense mutations of the APC gene) depending on the severity of the adenoma polyps. Read-through therapy could also provide a way to control the adenoma polypody burden in those possessing somatic nonsense mutations of their APC gene. </p>

		<p>With NGS it is possible to detect germline nonsense mutations in the APC gene and to detect somatic nonsense mutations in the in CRC tumours to see who can potentially benefit from read-through therapy. </p>

		<article> <h4> TP53 </h4>
			<p>The TP53 gene codes for the well known p53 protein which plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle. Given the role of TP53 in CRC and cancer in general. The gene has attracted much attention from scientists. NGS allows the ability to determine the genetic integrity of the TP53 gene and below I will discuss a couple of methods that can be implemented to treat CRC patients that have been identified as possessing mutations of their TP53 gene.</p>

			<h4>Activation of p73</h4>
			<p>TAp73 is a gene that encodes the p73 protein, a protein that bears functional similarity to p53 tumour suppressor protein.</p>
			<p>It has been shown by <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4161/cbt.7.12.7461">Lu, Wang and El-Deiry 2008 </a> that NSC176327 (3-(9-methoxy-5,11-dimethylpyrido[4,3-b]carbazol-6-yl)propan-1-amine), a close derivative of elliciptine, is able to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in Tp53 null human colon cancer cells. This was in large part due to upregulating of p73. Consequenctly, upregulation of p73 through NSC176327 may serve as a therapeutic strategy for CRC patients with defective mutant or null Tp53.  </p>

			<h4>MDM2 Antagonists to protect healthy cells during chemotherapy</h4>
			<p>Nutlins are a group of molecules that inhibit MDM2-P53 binding. MDM2 is a protein that negatively regulates p53. Nutlins occupy the binding region of MDM2 preventing MDM2-p53 interaction. This allows p53 to continue its action which includes arresting the cell cycle. Thus, by pretreating cells carrying wild-type Tp53 with nutlins it is possible to take them out of the cell cell cycle before the chemotherapy agent paclitaxel induces mitosis-arrest and subsequently apoptosis</p>
			<p> A study conducted by <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/65/5/1918/518849/Activation-of-p53-by-MDM2-Antagonists-Can-Protect">Carvajal et al., 2005 </a> found that by pretreating cancerous colon cells with wild-type Tp53 protected the cells from the widely used chemotherapy agent paclitaxel. Conversely, in breast cancer cells carrying mutated Tp53 pretreatment with nutlins did not affect their sensitiv0ity to paclitaxel and treatment with paclitaxel led to a loss of cell viability. </p>

			<p>By sequencing colorectal cancer tissue for deleterious Tp53 mutations. We can determine whether a patient can benefit from using nutlins during chemotherapy. This method will help to protect their healthy cells, hopefully decreasing the side effects of chemotherapy. </p>

		<h4>NGS: benefits and limitations</h4>
		<p>To summarise, NGS of CRC can provide many benefits as described above. However, despite all the benefits there are limitations to the NGS of CRC such as ethical issues that arise due to genetic testing and data sharing. When ‘consenting’ to allowing their data to be shared it’s unlikely the patient or even professionals can predict how the data can be used in the future especially in light of future unknown technological advancements that may occur </p>

		<p>Even though the cost of NGS has come down tremendously from $100 million a genome in 2001 to $562 in 2021 <a href="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/DNA-Sequencing-Costs-Data">(genome.gov)</a> $562 per genome would become quite expensive if it was performed for a large number of patients. </p>

		<p> And in general genomic medicine faces the issue of not having enough healthcare professionals educated about available tests. During a survey of healthcare professionals involved in the <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/11/e029699"> 100,000 Genomes project </a> one issue that was raised was that doctors were not trained to accurately interpret the results of genome sequencing. In addition, a lack of resources for the analysis and interpretation of results was also mentioned (Sanderson, 2019). </p>
