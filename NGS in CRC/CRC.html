		<h4> Colorectal Cancer </h4>
		<p> Cancer is a general term for diseases characterised by abnormal cell growth. There are more than 200 different types of cancer. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is cancer of the colon or rectum (see image for diagram of the digestive system). </p>

		<p> As is the case with all cancers, mutations in oncogenes, tumour suppressor genes and genes relating to the DNA repair mechanism can lead to CRC. The development of CRC typically follows mutations of the APC, KRAS, PI3K and TP53 genes (Mármol et al., 2017). </p>

		<p> CRC can be categorised as sporadic, familial or inherited.  Sporadic CRC accounts for 70% of CRC and typically begins with mutations in the APC gene, a tumour suppressor. Familial CRC accounts for 25% of CRCs. However, they are not categorised as inherited CRC as they do not belong to any inherited cancer variant. CRC Typically begins with mutations in the APC gene, a tumour supprresor gene.  </p>

		<p> In inherited CRC individuals inherit a mutation in one of their alleles and a somatic mutation in the other results in the development of a tumour cell. There are two main groups of inherited CRC: polyposis and non-polyposis. The polyposis variant typically involves Familial adenomatous polyposis, a genetic condition which is characterised by the development of adenomatous polyps in the epithelium of the colon which have the potential to become malignant. The non-polyposis variant is related to mutations of the DNA repair mechanisms. The main variant in this condition is Lynch Syndrome which is caused my a mutation in one of the alles encoding the DNA repair proteins such as MSH2, MLH1, MLH6, PMS1 and PMS2. </p> 

		<p>Given the nature of CRC it can stand to benefit from genomic medicine. ‘Genomic medicine is an emerging medical discipline that involves using genomic information about an individual as part of their clinical care‘ <a href="https://www.genome.gov/health/Genomics-and-Medicine">(NIH, 2020)</a> and advances in genomic technologies have allowed the identification of a plethora of genomic aberrations involved in CRC. One such advancement is the development of next generation sequencing (NGS) also known as massively parallel sequencing. </p>
