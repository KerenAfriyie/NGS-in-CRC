		<h4> Introduction</h4>
		<p>Personalised medicine is a term used to describe the concept of tailoring medical treatments to the specific characteristics of each patient. Medicine has generally involved performing broad diagnosis based on characteristic symptoms and prescribing a medication to treat the illness causing the symptom(s). Personalised medicine involves classifying individuals into subpopulations that are uniquely or disproportionaley susceptible to a particular disease or response to a specific treatment. </p>

		<h4>Importance of genomic sequencing</h4>
		<p> Environmental factors play a role in why susceptibility to disease and response to medication varies amongst individuals. However, a major factor in this variation is gene polymorphism. With whole genome sequencing it would be possible to predict an individual's susceptibility to disease based on their genomic profile allowing for early diagnosis and enhanced disease detection. Upon diagnosis of disease instead of providing a broad one size fits all diagnosis it will also be possible to then categorise patients into subpopulations based on their genomic profile and then target those subpopulations with the most effective drugs.
